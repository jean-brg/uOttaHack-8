# TeachSim
by Floor 5

Have you ever wanted to improve your coaching skills? With TeachSim, you can practice explaining in front of a group of AI students that consider your explanation and ask probing questions. Practice with any topic and get prompted by different AI models to consider gaps in your explanation or areas of improvement, and recieve feedback on your performance. 

We wanted to turn the tables on traditional human-AI interaction: rather than commands or prompts, the user is given food for thought and suggestions for how to improve a permanently relevant skill -- knowledge sharing. To further simulate the diverse thought patterns of a real classroom, TeachSim employs a multitude of models in its question generation phase and uses Gemini to moderate lesson accuracy/relevancy and question success rate.

This is where we reflect on our experience in the hackathon.

## Hackathon Design Challenges
It was our first hackathon and first time using AI APIs for all members on the Floor 5 team, and this brought a widge range of challenges to the team.
- **Brainstorming**: We spent a large amount of time deliberating on an app idea that incorporated AI and allowed us to expand our toolkits.
- **Synchronized workflows**: Many of us had to adapt to using Git in new ways (and for the first time, for some of us)
- **Problem solving**: For many issues, the best methodology was unclear early in the development process and we often found ourselves considering several solutions to a problem, choosing one, and then backtracking later due to unforeseen factors. For example, the Gemini API allowed for some great JSON schema validation, but we quickly ran into rate limits on our personal API keys. 
- **Documentation**: We weren't very good at journalling our brainstorming or thought processes which sometimes made it hard to return to earlier trains of thought or following each others' logic trains. It would've been helpful to form an abstract mission and objectives first without considering a method, and then adapting that later. 
- **Research**: As a lot of this territory was new, we found ourselves doing a lot of research and reading docs instead of designing.
