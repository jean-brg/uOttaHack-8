    <!-- Carbon atoms have 6 valence electrons (2 in their first shell and 4 in their second). Since the second shell can have 8 electrons, the carbon's valence, or exterior, is only half full, allowing for many bonding opportunities. -->

        An atom is the tiny building block of everything in the universe, consisting of three main subatomic particles. At the very center lies the nucleus, a dense core made up of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons.
        Swirling around this nucleus at incredible speeds are tiny, negatively charged particles called electrons. These electrons move within specific areas called shells or energy levels, which make up most of the atom's volume despite being mostly empty space. The balance between the positive pull of the nucleus and the negative charge of the electrons is what holds the entire structure together.
